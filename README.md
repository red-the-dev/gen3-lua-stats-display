# gen3-pokemonstatsdisplay

Pokémon stats display Lua script (player's team and enemy). Works with every gen 3 game

This is a modified version of the FractalFusion's stat viewer lua script (go [here](http://tasvideos.org/forum/viewtopic.php?p=351862#351862) for the original and to see how to use it). It basically does the same things: displays your team's and opponent's stats on the screen, but automatically detects your game version and language so you don't need to change anything to adapt it between different versions/languages.

## Games and languages supported

The script automatically detects every gen 3 Pokémon game (Ruby, Sapphire, Emerald, FireRed, LeafGreen) and languages:
- English
- Italian
- German
- Spanish
- French
- Japanese

but it only works with english and italian versions. Other languages are arleady mapped, so the only thing that's missing is the starting byte for each game. Feel free to edit.

**Update: Now Spanish FireRed/LeafGreen are supported too :)
